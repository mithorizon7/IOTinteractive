Make them understandable to true beginners

Here’s how I’d rewrite each one so that someone with zero IT background can still understand and make a good call, but you still sneak in useful real-world concepts.

Vulnerabilities (use these wordings on the cards)

Default password on outdoor camera
🔁 Suggested card text:

“Using the factory-set default password on an outdoor security camera.”
Why this is better:

“Factory-set” hints “this came from the manufacturer and everyone has the same one.”

“Security camera” is a concrete thing they can picture.

No remote update mechanism
🔁 Suggested card text:

“IoT device that cannot be updated over the network (you must visit it in person to install updates).”
Why this is better:

“Updated over the network” is understandable in plain language.

Parenthetical gives just enough context: “you must visit it in person” = painful + risky.

Physically accessible device enclosure
🔁 Suggested card text:

“IoT device installed where anyone can easily reach it and open its case.”
Why this is better:

Replaces “device enclosure” with “case,” which is much more everyday.

“Anyone can easily reach it” clearly signals “this is easy to tamper with.”

Mitigations (use these wordings on the cards)

Network segmentation (separate IoT VLAN)
🔁 Suggested card text:

“Putting IoT devices on their own separate network so they cannot directly reach more sensitive systems.”
And if you want a tiny helper line in the UI:
“(Like putting them in their own ‘lane’ so problems are contained.)”
Why this is better:

Drops “VLAN” entirely from learner-facing text—it’s unnecessary jargon.

Still teaches the core idea: separate network = damage containment.

Strong, unique credentials
🔁 Suggested card text:

“Using strong, unique passwords for each IoT device and login.”
Why this is better:

Swaps “credentials” for “passwords” and “login,” which every adult understands.

“For each IoT device” subtly teaches that devices have their own logins.

Regular patching policy
🔁 Suggested card text:

“Regularly installing software updates on all IoT devices.”
(If you want to add one more phrase:)
“…to fix security problems and bugs.”
Why this is better:

Uses “software updates,” which ties back to the article’s “difficult to update / outdated software” language.

You still smuggle in the underlying concept of security patches without the jargon.

3. Are these the best six, given the readings?

For a 5–10 minute minigame with learners who have:

only seen the four articles, and

zero prior IT/IoT background,

this set is strong overall:

The three vulnerabilities align tightly with the article’s examples:

Hard to update → “no remote update mechanism.”

Physical tampering → “physically accessible device.”

Easy access / poor security → “default password.”

The three mitigations are core security hygiene:

Separate network = contain damage.

Strong unique passwords = basic access control.

Regular updates = address the outdated-software risk.

The only borderline one is the original wording of “Network segmentation (separate IoT VLAN)”. With the simplified phrasing above, it becomes appropriate and accessible.

If you wanted to slightly bias closer to the text, the only swap I’d even consider is:

Instead of network segmentation, a mitigation like

“Limiting which systems IoT devices are allowed to connect to.”
which is conceptually similar but even less technical.

I don’t think that’s necessary, though, if you adopt the plain-language rewrite.
