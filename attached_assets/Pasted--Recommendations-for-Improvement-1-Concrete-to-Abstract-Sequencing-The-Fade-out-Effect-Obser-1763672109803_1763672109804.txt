🚀 Recommendations for Improvement
1. Concrete-to-Abstract Sequencing (The "Fade-out" Effect)

Observation: The "Sequencer" game (SEQ-1) asks for the abstract loop: Sense → Share → Process → Act.

Critique: For a beginner, this is purely abstract.

Recommendation: Add a "Concrete Sequencer" item before the abstract one.

Example: "Order the steps of this Smart Thermostat: 1. Thermometer reads 70°F. 2. Wi-Fi sends temp to cloud. 3. Cloud decides 'Too cold'. 4. Furnace turns on."

Benefit: This grounds the abstract concepts in reality before asking for the general rule.

2. Visual Anchoring for "DecisionLab"

Observation: The IOT-1 to IOT-4 questions are text-only.

Recommendation: Even simple icons or schematic SVGs next to the prompt (e.g., a diagram of the RFID gate for IOT-2) would significantly reduce cognitive load. Dual-coding theory suggests text + image improves retention.

3. The "Counter-Example" Mechanic

Observation: You mentioned a "CounterExample" mechanic in the brief, but it's implemented as just DecisionLab currently.

Recommendation: Explicitly frame a level as "Break the Rule."

Prompt: "People often say 'IoT is anything with Wi-Fi'. Select the device below that has Wi-Fi but is NOT IoT."

Options: Smart Bulb (IoT), Laptop (Not IoT), Smart Lock (IoT).

Benefit: This actively trains the learner to delineate the boundaries of the definition.

4. Elaborative Interrogation (The Rationale Box)

Observation: You have a rationale text box in DecisionLab, but it doesn't seem to do anything with the input other than log it.

Recommendation: In the feedback screen, mirror their rationale back to them next to the "Model Answer."

UI Text: "You said: [User's Rationale]. Expert Note: [Model Rationale]."

Benefit: This triggers self-reflection ("Did I get the right answer for the wrong reason?").

5. Spaced Repetition Tuning

Observation: The current chooseNextIndex logic is good (recent buffer + least seen).

Recommendation: If a user fails an item, don't just show it again later. Show a variant of it (an "Isomorph").

Implementation: If they fail "Is Bluetooth Headphones IoT?", the retry shouldn't be the exact same headphones question immediately. It could be "Are Bluetooth Speakers IoT?".

Why: To prevent pattern matching (memorizing "Headphones = No") and ensure concept mastery. (This requires expanding the content pack).

Summary
The engine is technically sound and pedagogically advanced compared to standard quizzes. Fixing the state-persistence bugs in iot-learning.tsx is the immediate priority. To elevate the learning outcomes, focus on visual dual-coding and concrete examples before abstract rules.
